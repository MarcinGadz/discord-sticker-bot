# discord-sticker-bot
Simple discord bot made from two parts:
  - private Spring Boot API: Used to manage stickers (small PNG images) on the AWS S3 Object Storage.
  It has also mode to run locally, using in-memory java List instead of AWS storage. To do it, you can use command `mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring.boot.run.profiles=LOCAL`.
  After that, it exposes a few endpoints on `http://localhost:8080`:
    - GET on `/{userId}` path - returns all images owned by specified user
    - GET on `/{userId}/{sticker}` path - returns example URL and some metadata about sticker specified by owner and name, or 404 code if sticker does not exist
    - POST on `/{userId}/{sticker}` path - adds sticker passed as MultiPart file, or returns proper response code when something went wrong (like user limit was exceeded)
    - DELETE on `/{userId}/{sticker}` path - removes specified sticker or returns 404 when such sticker does not exist  
    
    To locally run tests of API (both integrational and unit) use `mvn test` command.
    Both commands are supposed to be run from API root directory (`/api` in this repo)

  - public Discord bot service: Used to manage communication between users and API. 
  Users can call slash commands to manage their collection of stickers. These can have some required arguments with diffirent types.
    - `/upload` - adds new sticker to authorized user (takes image file with PNG extension and sticker name as arguments)
    - `/list` - shows list of user's stickers using paginated list (users can change pages using buttons)
    - `/remove` - removes specified by name sticker
    - `/send` - sends URL to specified sticker on the AWS S3 Object Storage which is interpreted by Discord application as an image
  Depending on command responses can be visible to everyone on the channel where command was executed (`/send`) or just to the user that called this command.

With this awesome bot you can have all your stickers in one place! ðŸ˜€
